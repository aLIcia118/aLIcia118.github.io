        <h2>Ideas Around Perception</h2>

        <p>In "Ways of Seeing", John Berger focuses mainly on the different factors that could affect how we view works of art. In silence, we could use our own thinking to determine the meaning/purpose behind the work of art. However, with the movement of a camera, the words around the art, and sound added could significantly alter how we interpret what we see. John Berger uses experiments to demonstrate the different factors affecting our interpretation. In the video, John Berger emphasizes that how we are presented objects/images will be how we interpret them.
