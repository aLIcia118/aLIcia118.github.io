        <h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
        <a href = "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">(link ♥)</a>
        <p>
            In “As We May Think” by Vannevar Bush, a Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development, 
            talks about a future where technology and information are inserted into a single application for every individual to access and utilize. 
            Many of the ideas that he mentions are what we see and use in our everyday lives now.

        <p>
            An example of technology Vannevar Bush mentions is a “memex” where individuals store all their information and documents to be 
            quickly and easily accessed. In which the “memex” acts as an “enlarged intimate supplement to his [one’s] memory”. 
            Vannevar Bush ultimately imagines a future where every individual whether scientists, researchers, thinkers, etc. could input 
            their knowledge into a form of a technological application for individuals to collectively access and utilize.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            The current technology that exists now shows a strong correlation with the ideas and predictions Vannevar Bush envisioned for the future. 
            Bush hoped that future people could easily access information and documents, similar to today where individuals could search the internet 
            easily and find the necessary information for their research. As a person in the past Bush was able to effectively communicate his ideas 
            on what he hopes technology to be in the future and what we have now reflects the accuracy of his prediction.
