        <h2><strong>Autobiography</strong></h2>
        <p>Tim Berners-Lee was born in 1955 and currently lives in London, England. He’s most known for being the inventor of the World Wide Web in 1989. In addition to the World Wide Web, he invented HTML markup language, the URL system, and HTTP.

        <p>
            In “Long Live the Web” by Tim Berners-Lee, he discusses his beliefs about the web and how individuals should perceive and use the web. Berners-Lee mentions how the web works with websites and links created through HTML, URLs, etc., and emphasizes the importance of resources related to the web to be free and to have an open mentality when it comes to the web to encourage improvement and development.

            “ The goal of the Web is to serve humanity. We build it now so that those who come to it later will be able to create things that we cannot ourselves imagine. ”

        <h2>Reflection</h2>

        <p>
            After further research on Tim Berners-Lee from reading this article, I was surprised to find that he was the inventor of the World Wide Web. Although I have always been using the web and have known of the World Wide Web I did not expect it to be only created during 1989, showing how fast technology has evolved in a short period of time. A majority of the points Berners-Lee mentions are agreeable, to ensure the success of the web, where security/privacy, collaboration of users, and accessibility of the web should be protected and easily accessed.
